# ChatBots

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech. A chatbot is a type of software that can automate conversations and interact with people through messaging platforms. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test.


## Background

It basically solve time problem and it help humans

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* It operate 24/7
* It provides guidance to the users
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

When the users are not available to answer the questions due to time problems than this is useful because it can operate 24/7.




## Data sources and AI methods
We have our own training data stored in arrays

## Challenges

The questions which are not easy and only humans can answer

## What next?

It will answer all the questions which right now he isn't able to answer which are answered by the humans.
